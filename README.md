  # Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
   Driver pass is looking to create a platform for individuals to improve their driving skills, prior to taking their test at the DMV. They want us to create a web based system through a cloud provider. They would like for user to be able to schedule drives by themselves online. Furthermore, they want users to be capable of taking practice tests as well. Finally, they wanted a pleasant looking user interface to display all of a user's information.
  
  # What did you do particularly well?
   I did I great job at gathering the requirements of the client. We interviewed the team members of the Driver Pass system and wrote a transcript of everything mentioned in the meeting. Through this, I was able to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
  
  # If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   I would choose to revise the UML case diagram. I feel like there is more information that I could have added. For instance, I should have a use case for sending the admin notification when the system runs into errors.
  
  # How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I interpreted the users needs by carefully analyzing the information that was provided by the client and users. Through this, I was able to create an outline of functional and non-functional requirements in the system. Defining those requirements allowed for me to start making recommendations within those confines. It is important to consider the users need because you want the user to enjoy the system you created. In order to make a system profitable, like this one, you must ensure that the system's functionality is tailored to the consumers.
   
  # How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   For designing the software I used a form of the System design Life Cycle:
  1. Planning
  2. Feasibility Study
  3. System Design
  4. Implementation
  5. Testing
  6. Deployment
  7. Maintenance

  This life cycle will prove to be very beneficial for the later instances in my careers. The cycle is straight forward and outlines every stage to designing a system.
